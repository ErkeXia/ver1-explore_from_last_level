Validate prompt: 
You are an expert verifier and coach for the Game of 24.

Goal  
Check a multi-step attempt that should turn four numbers into **24** using only + - * /.  
Besides legality, detect the first step after which **no further legal moves can ever reach 24**.

Required output
---------------
Return **one line** in **one** of these three forms:

1. Yes - Answer: a op b op c op d = 24  
   # all steps legal, final remaining number is 24

2. No, invalid at step N - Should be: x op y = z (left: …)  
   # first illegal or blocking step **and** you can suggest a concrete fix

3. No, invalid at step N  
   # first illegal or blocking step, but no clear single-step fix exists

Procedure
---------
• Walk through the steps in order, ensuring  
   x and y are in the current multiset,  
   z is the correct result of x op y (no ÷0),  
   the stated “left” multiset is correct.  

• If any check fails or the new multiset can never make 24, emit form 2 or 3.  
  (Use form 2 only when you can give one better replacement line.)

• When all steps finish:  
   one remaining number = 24 → form 1  
   otherwise → “invalid” at the last step (form 3).

Examples
Input: 4 4 6 8

Judge:
Yes - Answer: (4 + 8) * (6 - 4) = 24

Validate prompt: 
You are an expert verifier and coach for the Game of 24.

Goal  
Check a multi-step attempt that should turn four numbers into **24** using only + - * /.  
Besides legality, detect the first step after which **no further legal moves can ever reach 24**.

Required output
---------------
Return **one line** in **one** of these three forms:

1. Yes - Answer: a op b op c op d = 24  
   # all steps legal, final remaining number is 24

2. No, invalid at step N - Should be: x op y = z (left: …)  
   # first illegal or blocking step **and** you can suggest a concrete fix

3. No, invalid at step N  
   # first illegal or blocking step, but no clear single-step fix exists

Procedure
---------
• Walk through the steps in order, ensuring  
   x and y are in the current multiset,  
   z is the correct result of x op y (no ÷0),  
   the stated “left” multiset is correct.  

• If any check fails or the new multiset can never make 24, emit form 2 or 3.  
  (Use form 2 only when you can give one better replacement line.)

• When all steps finish:  
   one remaining number = 24 → form 1  
   otherwise → “invalid” at the last step (form 3).

Validate prompt: 
You are an expert verifier and coach for the Game of 24.

Goal  
Check a multi-step attempt that should turn four numbers into **24** using only + - * /.  
Besides legality, detect the first step after which **no further legal moves can ever reach 24**.

Required output
---------------
Return **one line** in **one** of these three forms:

1. Yes - Answer: a op b op c op d = 24  
   # all steps legal, final remaining number is 24

2. No, invalid at step N - Should be: x op y = z (left: …)  
   # first illegal or blocking step **and** you can suggest a concrete fix

3. No, invalid at step N  
   # first illegal or blocking step, but no clear single-step fix exists

Procedure
---------
• Walk through the steps in order, ensuring  
   x and y are in the current multiset,  
   z is the correct result of x op y (no ÷0),  
   the stated “left” multiset is correct.  

• If any check fails or the new multiset can never make 24, emit form 2 or 3.  
  (Use form 2 only when you can give one better replacement line.)

• When all steps finish:  
   one remaining number = 24 → form 1  
   otherwise → “invalid” at the last step (form 3).

You should response (sure/likely/impossible)
EXAMPLES:
Input: 10 14
10 + 14 = 24
sure

Input: 11 12
11 + 12 = 23
12 - 11 = 1
11 * 12 = 132
11 / 12 = 0.91
impossible

Input: 4 4 10
4 + 4 + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18
4 * 10 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
(10 - 4) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24
sure

Input: 4 9 11
9 + 11 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24
sure

Input: 5 7 8
5 + 7 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20
(8 - 5) * 7 = 3 * 7 = 21
I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
likely

Input: 5 6 6
5 + 6 + 6 = 17
(6 - 5) * 6 = 1 * 6 = 6
I cannot obtain 24 now, but numbers are within a reasonable range
likely

Input: 10 10 11
10 + 10 + 11 = 31
(11 - 10) * 10 = 10
10 10 10 are all too big
impossible

Input: 1 3 3
1 * 3 * 3 = 9
(1 + 3) * 3 = 12
1 3 3 are all too small
impossible

TASK:
Input: 5 9 9

LLAMA output: 
Let's try different combinations:

5 + 9 + 9 = 23
9 + 9 + 5 = 23
9 + 5 + 9 = 23
9 * 5 + 9 = 54 + 9 = 63
9 * 9 - 5 = 81 - 5 = 76
5 * 9 - 9 = 45 - 9 = 36
9 * 9 / 5 = 81 / 5 = 16.2
5 * 9 + 9 = 45 + 9 = 54
9 * 9 + 5 = 81 + 5 = 86
9 * 5 + 9 = 45 + 9 = 54

It seems I cannot reach 24 with the given numbers.
likely

LLAMA output: 
Let's evaluate the possibilities:

5 + 9 + 9 = 23
9 + 9 - 5 = 13
9 * 9 - 5 = 74 - 5 = 69
9 / 5 + 9 = 1.8 + 9 = 10.8
5 + 9 - 9 = 5
9 + 9 - 5 = 13
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 9 + 9 = 45 + 9 = 54
5 + 9 + 9 = 23
9 * 9 - 5 = 74 - 5 = 69
(9 - 5) * 9 = 4 * 9 = 36
(5 + 9) * 9 = 14 * 9 = 126
I cannot obtain 24 with the given numbers
likely

LLAMA output: 
5 + 9 + 9 = 23
(9 - 5) * 9 = 4 * 9 = 36
(9 - 9) * 5 = 0 * 5 = 0
(9 + 5) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5
(9 + 5) / 9 = 14 / 9 = 1.55
(5 + 9) * 9 = 14 * 9 = 126
(9 - 5) / 9 = 4 / 9 = 0.44
(9 - 5) * 9 = 4 * 9 = 36
(5 + 9) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5
I tried many combinations, but I couldn't reach 24.
likely

LLAMA output: 
Let's try to evaluate if these numbers can reach 24 with basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /).

First, let's add the numbers:
5 + 9 + 9 = 23

Since we can't get 24 by adding them, let's try multiplying and dividing:
(9 - 5) * 9 = 4 * 9 = 36
(9 - 5) / 9 = 4/9 = 0.44
5 * 9 * 9 = 405
5 / 9 * 9 = 5/9 * 9 = 5

It's clear that the numbers are not too small or too big, so let's try some other combinations:
9 + 5 = 14
9 + 9 = 18
9 - 5 = 4
9 - 9 = 0
5 + 9 = 14
5 - 9 = -4
5 * 9 = 45
5 / 9 = 0.56

Now, let's try combining these results:
(9 - 5) * 9 = 36 (too big)
(9 - 5) + 9 = 13 (not 24)
(9 - 5) + 5 = 9 (not 24)
(9 - 5) * 5 = 20 (not 24)
(9 - 5) / 9 * 9 = 0.44 * 9 = 3.96 (not 24)

At this point, it's clear that we can't get 24 by combining these numbers in a reasonable way. However, we still have some possibilities left:
(5 * 9) + 9 = 45 + 9 = 54 (too big)
(5 * 9) - 9 = 45 - 9 = 36 (too big)
(5 * 9) * 9 = 405 * 9 = 3645 (too big)

Since none of these combinations work, and we've exhausted all reasonable possibilities, I would say:

impossible
